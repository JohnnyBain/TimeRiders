#TimeRiders

Time riders is a single player, turn based puzzle game that sees you travelling through time to make multiple deliveries in the same time and space.
With each delivery the roads will become more and more crowded so it's important to plan your routes ahead of time. 

Each rider is colour coded and so are their start and end points in the level.
A small square in a tile denotes where the rider of that colour will spawn.
A large square in a tile denotes where the rider of that colour will need to deliver to.

The temporal engine in your vehicle leaves behind a rip in space time. This trail grows up to a length of 6 tiles and occupies the spaces you've travelled through.
When a rider reaches their destination, the trail remains at full length and does not diminish.

Contact between two riders will end the level
Contact between a rider a trail will end the level

As you input directions, if the move is valid (is not into a wall) the rider will be moved into that space. Any of your previous rides will step through
the route that you drove for their delivery.

A level is complete when all the riders have completed their deliveries and thereâ€™s been no crashes between riders. If you finish your current ride before your old routes 
have concluded, the routes will continue to play out.

If the player crashes during a ride they can choose to restart the entire level (doing every delivery again), or they can replay just the ride they were playing when
they crashed.
